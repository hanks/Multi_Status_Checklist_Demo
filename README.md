Multi Status Checklist Demo
===========================

A feasibility experiment about a multi status checklist, and think about another user experience for traditional checklist.

## Why
I like to use <a href="https://trello.com/">trello</a> to do task management, and one of my favorite is **checklist**.

It is a **standard** checklist implementation:  
- add or delete item in list  
- move item up and down  
- checkbox to check when finish this item  
- progress bar to show status  

Like below:

When I use checklist to start a task, I like to do brain storm firstly to write down many targets and ideas, then arrange their priorities, and finish them and check them one by one.  

The problem is some of targets or ideas are hard to implemented actually or there is another solutions to solve the same issues, to make sure the whole task will be done at the 100% progress at the end, to the standard checklist, I have to delete these hard items in the checklist now. **But sometimes I just want to leave them as history records.** 

So I found if there is a third status to represent **cancel**, and not just **check** and **uncheck**, this need might be perfectly meet. It can just saved in the checklist as a memo and do not affect the progress of the whole task. 

And some another ideas about checklist, like:  
- can set the timer to each item, add a alarm icon on the item will be fun  
- can set priority to each item, and sort automatically  
- when check one item, it will be moved to bottom automatically  
- and so on  

## Demo
So based on ideas above, I made this to demonstrate user experience of the checklist in my mind. It is not fully implemented and just a feasibility study.
